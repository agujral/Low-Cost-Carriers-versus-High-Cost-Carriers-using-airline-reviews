Is there really a difference? Low Cost Carriers versus High Cost Carriers using airline reviews

I trained and tested the model in order to study the sentiments of the reviews and also conducted a comparative study for the Low Cost and High Cost carriers to find out the main features of airline reviews. The findings reveal that the traveler sentiments can be predicted with high accuracy and the comparative feature study can help in figuring out the main reason for sentiment variation. I believe that my research work would be beneficial for the airline carriers to study customer sentiments and also to take decisions to change their business model accordingly.
